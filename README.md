# uSearch

Some guidelines:

- Always pull before making any commits
- U can import this repo as a project in eclipse, and put ur java files in the src folder
- When pushing, only push the files you have modified (dont push the bin, settings, others files used while development)
- Try to push individual files instead of the whole folder
- If u made multiple change to one file, state them in the commit seperated by ";"
- If there seems to be a bug in others code, make an issue on github or just message in the group chat

Goals for this week:
- Sort module(Sort.java) & jsunit for sort(TestSort.java)
- Search moduel(Search.java) & jsunit for search(TestSearch.java)
- Processed dataset (will be done outside of src, the final data will be in the data folder)
- UI structure 
- javadoc if u want, we will have to do it anyways
